Experiments overview 
DVC vs MLFLOW
MLFLOW for datascience 
Mlflow server architecture (AWS vs DAshhub)
Model REgistry

Lets talk about experiments 
in model training we need to do experiments to get high accuracy
lets suppose we use different techniques to do data cleaning method 1 give high accuracy not second one
same in hyper parameter tuning , feature engineering after performing all techniques we train model and track which one was the good one to deploy

Question DVC provide why Mlflow
it is good for data versioning 
mlflow is mature that dvc for tracking 
dvc is good for data versioning and mlflow is good for tracking experiments
DVC ui is not good for tracking experiments

mlflow have great ui for tracking experiments
good for model registry
