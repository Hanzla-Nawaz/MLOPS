when we build an app or project the we have requirements.txt andother dependencies 
that will be compatible
e.g sklearn version will be with spacific version of fastapi
so for that we have this container in which we will add all code plus all dependencies and send to QA 
and dev team 
Now whe have why of docker 
help developer build package and deploy 
docker container is running image, stop container called image 


the server of production might have 1000 gb ram so server have multiple app deployed on it
so apps deployed using docker because for isolation so app will not affect each other 
VMs: if dev team using mac but build in windows so we need virtual machine that will be tidious task 

docker: to avoid this we need docker 
it's lightweight, takes seconds to migrate 


content in docker file 
key componenets 
FROM: Specifies the base image 
COPY or ADD: Adds files from your host systems into the image
RUN: execute commands in the image such as intalling software
CMD or ENtrypoint: defines the commamd that runs when the container starts 
Expose: Specifies the port the container will listen on
